Bird vs. Worm

Worm is trying to escape from Bird.

Bird is trying to catch Worm.

Worm is trying to reach the hole.

Action plan/general idea:
- Run simulation
- Implement movement logic for Bird and Worm
- Check for collision detection
- Determine win/loss conditions
- Track attempts, completion time.
- Collect data for analysis
- Feedback loop for improvements on worm's movement strategy
- Train
- Test and refine the model
- Final evaluation and reporting


# config
global FIELD_SIZE# The field is 100x100 units
global SAFE_ZONE_POS # Target coordinates for the worm
#input asks for x and y seperately , then formats it

global BIRD_SPEED
global CATCH_RADIUS  # Distance at which the bird catches the worm
global WORM_SPEED
global STEP_TIME
